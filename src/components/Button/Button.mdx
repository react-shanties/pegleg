# Button

A button is an interactive element that signals the user can click. Use this for
calls to action, and minimize the number of buttons on a given page.

In regular HTML, the default type of a button is `submit`. This has unintended
issues such as doing page navigations. Read more
[here](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/button-has-type.md).
Pegleg aims to provide a more common-sense approach, so we use a default `type="button"`.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} sourceState="shown" />

If you need a `submit` button, you can absolutely pass a `type="submit"`

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Submit} sourceState="shown" />
<Controls of={ButtonStories.Submit} include={['type']} />

## Accessibility

### Role

By default, HTML `button`'s have the `role="button"`. This should not change, as
semantically using a button for something other than a button is generally a bad
user experience. Pegleg does not allow you to alter a button's role.

### Label

If you have a simple button with text children, the accessibility will pull the
text content as the label. You can still override this via the `label` property.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} sourceState="shown" />

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.LabelOverride} sourceState="shown" />

If you use complex children in your button (anything that isn't a string), the
`label` property is no longer optional and must be passed.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.ComplexChildren} sourceState="shown" />
